# Neural Networks and Linear ALgebra

My introduction to machine learning was with neural networks; writing a perceptron in C++, connecting them in to a neural network and implementing backpropagation. It was a pleasant surprise to realise that a lot of the complicated classes and functions that I had worked on could be represented as matrices and using matrix multiplication.

[This is an excellent article](https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/) on what linear algebra (and by extension matrix multiplication is.
