Tibbles and data.table are o exactly the same and it's worth noting the difference.
See here where we try to get the rownames from by converting to data.table then to a tibble
There is probably a better way to do this.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
data("mtcars")

cars <- data.table(mtcars, keep.rownames = TRUE) %>%
  select("rn", "mpg", "cyl", "wt") %>%
  rename(names = rn) %>%
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl))

head(cars)

qplot(x = mpg, y = wt, data=cars, geom= c("point", "smooth"))
```
