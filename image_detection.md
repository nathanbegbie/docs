# Image Detection - Deep Learning

## Satelite Imagery Analysis

Here are some blog write-ups that have used deep learning for image detection:

* [Object Detection with Deep Learning on Aerial Imagery](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/object-detection-with-deep-learning-on-aerial-imagery-2465078db8a9)
* [https://deepsense.ai/deep-learning-for-satellite-imagery-via-image-segmentation/](https://deepsense.ai/deep-learning-for-satellite-imagery-via-image-segmentation/) (a write-up on placing 4th in the Dstl Kaggle competition)
