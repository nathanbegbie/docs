# Data Science Competitions
Online data science competitions.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - the most well known. Also offers an online platform on which to run code. Extensive documentation and community.
[DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org) - platform where all of the projects have a 'for good' aspect.
[Data Science Challenge](https://www.datasciencechallenge.org/) - sponsored by the UK government. This is not a platform, and appears to only run one challenge at a time.
[Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) - specific to Africa.
